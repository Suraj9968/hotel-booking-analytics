# Implementation Report: LLM-Powered Booking Analytics & QA System

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a hotel booking analytics and question answering system with the following components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline** (`Preprocessing.py`)
   - Cleans and processes raw booking data
   - Handles missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering
   - Stores processed data in both CSV and SQLite formats for flexibility

2. **Analytics Engine** (`Analytics.py`)
   - Computes and stores key insights from booking data
   - Implements precomputing strategy for efficient retrieval
   - Generates visualizations for human-friendly interpretation

3. **Retrieval-Augmented QA System** (`RAG_QA.py`)
   - Embeds booking data and insights in a vector database (ChromaDB)
   - Uses Google Gemini as the LLM for question answering
   - Implements hybrid retrieval combining vector search and SQL queries

4. **REST API** (`api.py`)
   - FastAPI-based interface for accessing analytics and QA functionality
   - Implements caching and resource pooling for performance
   - Includes health monitoring and query history tracking

5. **Performance Evaluation** (`performance_evaluation.py`)
   - Tests system accuracy using predefined questions
   - Evaluates API performance and response times
   - Generates visualizations and reports for analysis

## Key Implementation Choices

### 1. Precomputed Insights Strategy

One of the key design decisions was to precompute and store analytics insights rather than calculating them on-demand. This approach:

- **Improves API Response Time**: Retrieving pre-calculated insights is much faster than computing them from raw data each time
- **Enables Complex Calculations**: More complex analyses can be performed without impacting user experience
- **Supports Incremental Updates**: When new data arrives, only the affected insights need to be recalculated

### 2. Two-Tier Storage Approach

The system uses a two-tier storage approach:

- **SQLite Database**: For structured data and efficient SQL queries
- **Vector Database (ChromaDB)**: For semantic search and retrieval

This hybrid approach allows us to leverage the strengths of both:
- SQL for precise, structured queries with aggregate functions
- Vector search for semantically similar content and natural language processing

### 3. Hybrid RAG Implementation

The question answering system uses a hybrid retrieval approach:

- **Pattern Matching**: For common question types (e.g., "revenue for July 2017"), direct SQL queries are used
- **Vector Similarity**: For open-ended questions, semantic search in the vector database provides relevant context
- **Dual Collection Structure**: Separate collections for booking data and insights allow more targeted retrieval

### 4. Real-time Updates Support

The system is designed to handle new data efficiently:

- **Incremental Vector Updates**: Only new records are embedded and added to the vector database
- **Insight Recalculation**: Analytics are automatically regenerated when new data is detected
- **Update API Endpoint**: Provides a mechanism to trigger updates when new data arrives

### 5. API Design Choices

The API was designed with several key principles:

- **Stateless Operation**: No server-side session state for better scaling
- **Dependency Injection**: Resources like database connections are managed efficiently
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic models ensure request data is properly validated
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Structured error responses for client applications
- **Health Monitoring**: Dedicated endpoint to check system status
